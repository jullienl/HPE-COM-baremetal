# Inventory file example for Windows provisioning
#
#  Modify this inventory example file with information about the target servers you want to provision. 
#  Only three parameters are required:
#    •	Hostname: the OS hostname that will be configured (cautious: it is not the FQDN!)
#    •	os_ip_address: the IP address that will be assigned to the operating system
#    •	serial_number: the serial number of the server to be provisioned (found in COM)

localhost ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3 ansible_connection=local 
# localhost refers to the local machine on which Ansible is being run
# tells Ansible to use Python 3 as the interpreter for running modules
# local directive informs Ansible that it should execute the tasks locally instead of connecting over SSH
